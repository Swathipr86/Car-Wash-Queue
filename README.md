# Car-Wash-Queue
Implementing a queue data structure in a car wash ensures a fair and
efficient customer service process, following the 'first-in, first-out'
(FIFO) principle. Through computer programming, real-time
monitoring and management of the customer queue optimize the car
wash process, delivering high-quality service promptly. This organized
approach not only enhances efficiency but also contributes to
improved customer satisfaction, as customers experience predictable
and fair service without delays. Ultimately, the use of a queue data
structure in a car wash establishes trust, fostering customer loyalty
and repeat business."
